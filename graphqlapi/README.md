# GraphQL API in Rust

This project is a Rust-based application that exposes a GraphQL API. It is designed to demonstrate how to set up a GraphQL server using Rust, with a focus on modularity and clarity.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: Entry point of the application. Sets up the server and initializes the GraphQL API.
- `src/schema/mod.rs`: Defines the GraphQL schema, including types and queries that the API will expose.
- `src/resolvers/mod.rs`: Contains the resolver functions that implement the logic for fetching data for the GraphQL queries.
- `src/models/mod.rs`: Defines the data models used in the application, representing the structure of the data.
- `Cargo.toml`: Configuration file for Cargo, specifying the project metadata, dependencies, and build settings.
- `Cargo.lock`: Automatically generated by Cargo to lock the versions of dependencies used in the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `cargo build` to build the project.
5. Run `cargo run` to start the server.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the GraphQL API using a tool like Postman or GraphiQL. You can send queries and mutations to the API endpoint to fetch or modify data.
