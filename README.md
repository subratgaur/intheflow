Rust based IDP
AI-Driven Developer Portal with Hybrid Execution
Objective: Build an internal developer portal that automates the entire SDLC—from requirements to Day 2 operations—using AI for flexibility and Rust for determinism. The system integrates a knowledge graph, cross-language transpilation, and hybrid AI/Rust execution for business process orchestration.

1. Requirements

Functional

- AI-Driven Automation:

    - Generate code, tests, and docs from natural language requirements.

    - Self-healing workflows with AI-driven error correction.

- Cross-Language Transpilation:

    Convert projects between languages (e.g., COBOL → Rust) via a 3-step process:

    Source → Intermediate Representation (IR).

    Rearchitect IR for target language idioms.

    Generate Code (Rust/Java/Go) from IR.

- Business Process Orchestration:

    Map services to business processes/rules in user-friendly (BPMN) and LLM-friendly (JSON) formats.

    Execute workflows via AI decisions + Rust rule engine for determinism.

- GitOps & CI/CD:

    Argo Workflows/CD/Rollouts for pipelines and deployments.

Observability:

    AI-powered incident triage with SigNoz (logs/traces) and Prometheus (metrics).


Non-Functional

Performance: <1s latency for IDE suggestions; 1M+ rules/sec for Rust engine.
Security: OPA policies, Vault secrets, Semgrep scans.
Scalability: Horizontal scaling for AI/Rust components.
Reliability: 100% valid code generation via closed-loop testing.

2. Architecture

Core Components
AI Layer:
Models: DeepSeek-R1 (code gen/fixes), DeepSeek Coder (IDE).
Orchestration: LangChain for multi-step workflows.
Vector DB: Qdrant for RAG over docs/code.

Knowledge Graph:
Nodes: Services, code components, business processes, rules.
Edges: IMPLEMENTS, TRANSPILES_TO, HAS_RULE.
Tools: Apache Age (PostgreSQL), Cypher queries.

Rust Backend:
GraphQL API: Async-graphql + Axum for SDLC operations.
Rule Engine: Enforce deterministic business rules (e.g., "validate before charge").

CI/CD:
Argo Workflows: Self-healing pipelines with AI retry loops.
Argo CD: Sync AI-generated K8s manifests.

Frontend:
VS Code Extension: AI chat, code suggestions, Argo dashboards.
Portal UI (SvelteKit): Business process visualizations (BPMN).

3. Development Plan

Phase 1: Core Backend & Knowledge Graph (Weeks 1-4)
Rust GraphQL Server:
Setup async-graphql + Axum with JWT auth.
Integrate DeepSeek-R1 (vLLM/llama.cpp).
Knowledge Graph:
Model SDLC entities (services, code, processes) in PostgreSQL + Apache Age.
Argo Workflows:
Deploy Argo on Kubernetes; define base pipelines.

Phase 2: Transpilation & Business Mapping (Weeks 5-8)
Transpiler Engine:
Implement IR generator (Tree-sitter) and code synthesizer (DeepSeek-R1).
Business Taxonomy:
Define core terms (e.g., "Payment Processing") and map to code via static analysis.
Closed-Loop Testing:
Add pytest/Semgrep stages to Argo workflows.

Phase 3: UI & Observability (Weeks 9-12)
VS Code Extension:
Embed Monaco editor with DeepSeek Coder suggestions.
Real-time Argo workflow status.
Observability:
Deploy SigNoz for traces/logs; integrate AI incident triage.

Phase 4: Day 2 Autofix & Compliance (Weeks 13-16)
Post-Deployment Automation:
Argo Rollouts + AI analysis of metrics for auto-rollback.
Compliance Checks:
OPA policies mapped to business taxonomy rules.

4. Toolchain
Category	Tools
AI/ML	DeepSeek-R1, LangChain, Qdrant, Hugging Face
Backend	Rust, Axum, Async-graphql, NATS, Redis
CI/CD	Argo Workflows/CD/Rollouts, Crossplane
Knowledge Graph	Apache Age, Cypher, Tree-sitter
Security	OPA, Vault, Semgrep, Kyverno
Observability	SigNoz, Prometheus, Loki

5. Challenges & Mitigations
Challenge	Mitigation
AI Hallucinations	RAG with Qdrant; validate outputs with Rust rule engine.
State Management	Redis for session state; CRDTs for distributed consistency.
Legacy Code Gaps	Prioritize common transpilation paths (COBOL → Rust).
Rule-AI Conflicts	Hierarchy: Rust rules override AI decisions.

6. Outcomes
For Developers:
Zero boilerplate; AI handles coding, testing, and fixes.
IDE-integrated SDLC automation.

For Business:
Real-time mapping of code to business processes.
Self-healing deployments with AI-optimized rollouts.

Next Steps
Start with Phase 1 (Rust backend + knowledge graph).
Define initial business taxonomy (e.g., "Payment Processing").
Prototype a COBOL→Rust transpiler using Tree-sitter and DeepSeek-R1.
